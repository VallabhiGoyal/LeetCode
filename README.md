# LeetCode Practice (Java)

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, primarily written in **Java**.

The solutions are pushed automatically using **LeetHub**, which helps me maintain consistency and track progress.

## 📌 Focus Areas
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Problem-solving using Java
- Interview-oriented questions

## 📂 Structure
Each folder represents a LeetCode problem with:
- Problem statement
- Java solution
- Approach explanation (where applicable)

## ⚠️ Note
This repository is mainly for tracking my LeetCode practice.
My **structured and topic-wise DSA practice** is maintained in a separate repository.

## 🚀 Goal
To improve problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.
